I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at University of Helsinki.
In my research I tackle computationally hard combinatorial search and optimization problems with declarative methods.
My doctoral research focused on solving complex reasoning problems of computational argumentation by encoding them into Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and answer set programs (ASP).
