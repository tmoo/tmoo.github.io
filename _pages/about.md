I am a postdoctoral researcher funded by [HIIT](https://www.hiit.fi/) in computer science at Aalto University, with Professor [Jussi Rintanen](https://users.aalto.fi/~rintanj1/), and also affiliated with the [Constraint Reasoning and Optimization group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) at University of Helsinki.
My research interests include artificial intelligence, knowledge representation and reasoning, constraint solving, computational argumentation, and computationally hard combinatorial search and optimization problems.

My doctoral research focused on efficient reasoning tools for computational argumentation via Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and answer set programming (ASP).
I defended my PhD thesis [_Computational Approaches to Reasoning in Structured Argumentation_](https://hdl.handle.net/10138/358340) in June 2023 with [Henry Prakken](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~prakk101/) as the opponent. The thesis was accepted with distinction.

Previously
=====
- In 2020, I started my doctoral studies in the [Constraint Reasoning and Optimization group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) at University of Helsinki, with [full four-year funding from the university](https://fcai.fi/news/2020/2/28/new-doctoral-students-starting-work-on-multidisciplinary-applications-of-ai). My supervisors were [Matti Järvisalo](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/) and [Johannes P. Wallner](https://wallner.ist.tugraz.at/).
- I obtained my master's degree from University of Helsinki in 2019 and bachelor's degree in 2018.
