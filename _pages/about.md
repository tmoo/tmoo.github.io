I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at University of Helsinki in the [Constraint Reasoning and Optimization group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization).
In my research I tackle computationally hard combinatorial search and optimization problems with declarative methods.
My doctoral research focused on encoding reasoning with computational argumentation into Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and answer set programs (ASP) and using state-of-the-art solvers.
