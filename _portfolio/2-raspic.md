## [Source code and details](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/raspic/)

RASPIC is an ASP-based system for dynamic problems in the structured argumentation formalism ASPIC+ with and without preferences over rules. In particular, the system solves stability (can the justification status of a literal change given new information) and relevance (does adding a particular piece of information change the justification status of a literal) under the grounded semantics. RASPIC solves stability with answer set programming (ASP) encodings and relevance with counterexample-guided abstraction refinement algorithms based on incremental ASP.
