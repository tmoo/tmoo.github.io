## [Source code and details](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/coreo/aba2af/)

In assumption-based argumentation, queries about the acceptabilty of sentences in ABA under many semantics can be answered by translating the ABA framework to an AF and solving a corresponding reasoning task in the AF. This system does that translation, producing the necessary files which can be input to an ASP solver in order to answer the query.
