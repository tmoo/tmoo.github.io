## [Source code and details](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/aspforaspic/)

ASPforASPIC+ implements reasoning in the structured argumentation formalism of ASPIC+ based on direct answer set programming (ASP) encodings and incremental ASP solving, as detailed in [1,2].
It supports most central semantics in ASPIC+ without preferences and stable semantics under the elitist ordering and weakest-link principle.
