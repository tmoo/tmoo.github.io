## [Source code and details](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group(choicesat/)

choiceSAT implements algorithms for finding preferred models and deciding entailmend under various semantics in choice logics (namely qualitative choice logic QCL and conjunctive choice logic CCL). The approach, detailed in [1], makes use of MaxSAT, the optimization variant of SAT. The implementation clearly outperforms competing systems in terms of run time.
