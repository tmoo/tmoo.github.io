## [Source code and details](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/satfordl-aba/)

SATforDL-ABA is a SAT-based system for reasoning in the default logic instantiation of the structured argumentation formalism assumption-based argumentation (ABA). The approach covers the central semantics admissible, complete, stable and grounded. The system solves these problems with counterexample-guided abstraction refinement algorithms using incremental SAT solving.
